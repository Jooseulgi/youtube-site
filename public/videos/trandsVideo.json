        "description": "Today, I'm getting back surgery to remove a large tumor near my tailbone. It'll be a difficult procedure as the tumor is inside the spinal column and is surrounded by many nerves. Surgeons will have to make it through multiple bones to get in there and remove as much of it as possible. We then have to wait for biopsy results to figure out how to handle all the remaining tumors (I have a total of eight in my spine). It is looking most like I'll be needing radiation therapy as well as chemotherapy. \n\nThey believe what I have is something called Myxopapillary Ependymoma (MEPN). From what I'm researching online, it seems about one in a million people get this. It seems to be growing from the central nervous system out of the spinal cord rather than the brain, in my case. \n\nOver the last 18 months or longer, I've been experiencing an incredible amount of pain in my tailbone, hamstrings, calve muscles, lower back, and gluteus muscles. It is particularly painful when trying to do physical activity such as jumping, running, jogging, and even walking. It feels like a knife is being stabbed up into my tailbone area. So, it's been pretty painful filming my YouTube videos for a while now. This is why I haven't been doing as many martial arts and other fun and crazy physical challenges lately. Hopefully, after this surgery I'll be able to get back to normal life and doing all the fun things I used to do.\n\nThanks to all of you who have been super supportive and positive throughout this. I really appreciate it. Also, thank you to everybody at Keck Medicine at USC in Los Angeles, CA. Every single person I spent time with, surgeons, nurses, physical therapists, doctors, MRI technicians, etc... everybody was super positive and just had a really good attitude despite having a very difficult job. \n\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.

A heavy storm is rolling in and they'll have to stabilize their raft otherwise it'll get destroyed. Tonight is their last night on the water, so hopefully they will survive and make it to the 100 hour goal tomorrow and complete the challenge. Thank you for all of your support so far!

          "description": "Today is day 4 of surviving on a homemade raft for 100 hours. In this episode Chris and Jeff officially ran out of food. If they don't catch any fish, they're going to starve. A heavy storm is rolling in and they'll have to stabilize their raft otherwise it'll get destroyed. Tonight is their last night on the water, so hopefully they will survive and make it to the 100 hour goal tomorrow and complete the challenge. Thank you for all of your support so far! This challenge is to support ZOE, so any donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nSHOP OUR MERCH HERE:\nhttps://www.bonfire.com/store/dangie-bros/\n\nFOLLOW DANGIE BROS ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIAS (@TheDangieBros):\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DangieBrosVideos/\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedangiebros/?hl=en\n\nFOLLOW OUR PERSONAL INSTAGRAMS:\n\nFollow Chris on Instagram: (@christopherryan98)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/christopherryan98/?hl=en\n\nFollow Jeff on Instagram: (@jeffufahh)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeffufahh/?hl=en"
